# Administrative boundaries of Belgium based on Open Data available at Statistics Belgium

The  **BelgiumMaps.StatBel** package contains maps with administrative boundaries (national, regions, provinces, districts, municipalities, statistical sectors, agglomerations (200m)) of Belgium extracted from Open Data at Statistics Belgium (https://statbel.fgov.be/en/open-data/). Data is converted from Lambert CRS into the WGS84 coordinate reference system. 

This data is available in several objects:

- BE_ADMIN_SECTORS: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of the statistical sector
- BE_ADMIN_MUNTY: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of the municipality
- BE_ADMIN_DISTRICT: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of the district
- BE_ADMIN_PROVINCE: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of the province
- BE_ADMIN_REGION: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of the region
- BE_ADMIN_BELGIUM: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of the whole of Belgium
- BE_ADMIN_HIERARCHY: data.frame with administrative hierarchy of Belgium
- BE_ADMIN_AGGLOMERATIONS: SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with polygons and data at the level of an agglomeration (200m)
